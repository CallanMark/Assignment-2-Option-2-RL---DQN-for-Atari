    "# 1. Why Reinforcement Learning ? \n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns how to interact with its environment (breakout) through trial and error rather than learning to classify labelled examples like we seen in the first project.At each time step the agent receives information about the current game state i.e. (S,A,R,S′) and operates with the goal of maximising the long term reward(it's policy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why RL is the most suitable paradigm**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular task RL is preferred to other paradigms such as supervised and unsupervised as it naturally models sequential decision-making (Markov Decision Process)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning:** Supervised learning requires a dataset of labelled input-output pairs where the correct answer is known in advance i.e. their is some labeled data for the training set , This paradigm is well suited to image classification or regression but is not suitable for breakout due to the credit assignment problem , lack of a labelled dataset (experiences or stored unlabelled in the replay buffer) and its inability to model sequential decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unsupervised Learning:** \n",
    "While unsupervised learning is slightly more suitable than supervised as it learns the underlying patterns of unlabelled data (feature extraction) although it still lacks the ability to optimise actions based on a reward and interact with an environment and influence it meaning it is not a viable candidate for breakout  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reinforcement Learning:** \n",
    "In RL the learning occurs during a loop between the agent and its environment with the agent observing the current state , taking an action , receiving a reward for that action and learning to maximise the long term reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "RL is a particularly good fit for Atari games as they have high dimensional input , sequential decisions and delayed rewards (Success is dependant on a sequence of correct actions)"

    "# 3. Hyperparameters \n",
    "In this project we used the following hyperparameters initialised to these values. We choose these values with the aim of balancing the exploratation-exploitation tradeoff , stability and learning dynamics \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Discount Factor(𝛾)** : **γ=0.99** The discount factor (expressed as gamma in formulae) determines how much importance the agent should place on future rewards and long term planning relative to the immediate rewards.We used a value of 0.99 to make the agent value the long term consequences of its action as breakout is a game where rewards are delayed i.e. positioning the paddle paddle correctly correctly multiple steps before it hits the ball. In this context a high discount rate is required to learn to anticipate where to position the paddle ahead of time \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Learning Rate (LR)** : **LR=1×10^−4** The learning rate controls the size of the parameter updates during gradient descent.A learning rate that is too high can cause unstable training and oscillations in Q-values due to the large weight updates . Conversly a learning rate that is too low can lead to extremely slow learning due to the small weight updates. We can used a relatively small learning rate of 1×10^−4 to ensure stable convergence when working with noisy reward signals. This is in a similar range to the learning rate used in DeepMinds Atari DQN of 2.5×10^−4   \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Batch Size** : **32** This determines how many transitions to sample from the replay buffer during each training update. Smaller batch sizes introduce noise into the gradient estimates but improve generalisation which larger batch sizes increase stability but add additional computational overhead. We choose 32 as it was good balance between the computational resources available to us and learning stability \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Replay Buffer** : **100,000** We use the replay buffer to store past experiences in the form (s,a,r,s',done). We initialised it to store 100,000 transitions which ensures a sufficient diversity of experiences while not using an excessive amount of memory.Sampling uniformly from this buffer allows us to mitigates one of the core issues of RL which is catastrophic forgetting where experiences are overwritten/erased due to their high similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exploration Parameters (ε-Greedy)** : **Initial ε = 1.0, Final ε =0.02 ,Decay Rate =150,000**  The ε-greedy policy controls the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We set the initial value to 1.0 to force the agent to initially randomly explore the environment. Overtime ε decays exponentially , which encourages the agent to exploit its learned Q-values. A final ε of 0.02 ensures the agent does not fully rely on exploitation and prematurely converge to a suboptimal policy\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Target Network Update Frequency ** : **Every 1,000 steps** \n",
    "The target network is updated in intervals of 1,000 steps by copying over the weights of the online network. This helps to combat the instability introduced by the the rapidly changing target values in the Bellman update\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Frame Stacking (k)** : **k=4** Stacking multiple consecutive frame allows the agent to infer additional information about the game i.e. the speed and trajectory of the ball. Without frame stacking the agent would not be able to predict future ball positions as their is no trend of ball direction and speed to observe thus preventing learning  "

    "We use the **Replay Buffer**  to store transitions (s,a,r,s',done) , We then take random mini-batch samples to ensure learning updates occur across a diverse set of past states which reduces the risk of overwriting/erasing past experiences.This helps to prevent recency bias during parameter updates as well as breaking temporal correlations between consecutive states \n",

    "We use a **separate target network** to compute the bootstrap target in the bellman update , We update this periodically in intervals of (TARGET_UPDATE) to prevent oscillations in our Q-values and preserve learned value estimates \n",

    "**1. Raw Score (Cyan Line):**\n",
    "The light blue line represents the raw score obtained in each individual episode. As expected in Atari environments, this metric is highly volatile. A single mistake in *Breakout* leads to a lost life, meaning scores can fluctuate between 0 and 13 purely based on the initial ball trajectory or slight timing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. 50-Game Moving Average (Blue Line):**\n",
    "The dark blue line represents the moving average of the last 50 scores, which serves as a noise filter to reveal the true learning trend.\n",
    "* **Phase 1 (Episodes 0–200):** The curve remains flat around a score of 1.0–1.5. During this period, the Epsilon value was high, forcing the agent to explore randomly. The agent was merely hitting the ball by chance.\n",
    "* **Phase 2 (Episodes 200–600):** A distinct upward trend begins around Episode 200. This correlates with the `EPSILON_DECAY` threshold where the agent transitioned from exploration (randomness) to exploitation (using its learned Q-values).\n",
    "* **Final Performance:** By Episode 600, the average score stabilized around **6.0**, with peak raw scores reaching **13.0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The clear positive correlation between training steps and average reward confirms that the DQN agent has successfully learned to track the ball and intercept it, transitioning from random play to intelligent reaction."
